        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>Fat burgers are good old burgers with a classic recipe, the right size and at a reasonable price.</p>
        <p>They are prepared in the American, Mexican and Italian manners, sparing neither the sauce nor the filling.</p>
        <p>For those who are pretty hungry, there is an immense "Fattest Burger" with five beef patties, corn chips and cheese.</p>
